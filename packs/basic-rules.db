Below are guides for players and GMs</p>\n<h1>Guide for Players</h1>\n<h3>To Access Your Hand</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Click on the \"Open Hand\" button at the top of the character sheet, or</li>\n<li>Click on the hand that shows the name of your character in the Card Stacks tab in the side bar</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note: </strong>If you get an error message when attempting to open your hand, it means that your GM has not yet set up a hand for you. Ask your GM to set up a hand for your character (instructions for GMs are below).</p>\n<p>You may want to keep your hand open throughout the game so that it will be easy to access your cards.</p>\n<h3>To Draw a Destiny or Cosm Card</h3>\n<p>Click on the appropriate button at the bottom of your hand.</p>\n<h3>To View Your Cards</h3>\n<p>Hover over the thumbnail of the desired card in your hand.</p>\n<h3>To Show a Card to All Other Players</h3>\n<p>Click on the \"broadcast\" icon beside the appropriate card.</p>\n<h3>To Place or Remove a Card from Your Pool</h3>\n<p>Click on the \"In Pool?\" checkbox beside the appropriate card.</p>\n<h3>To Play, Discard, or Pass a Card</h3>\n<p>Click on the appropriate icon beside the card.</p>\n<h3>To See a Card That Another Player Has Played or Discarded</h3>\n<p>Look for a chat message relating to the action taken by the other player. Then, hover over the thumbnail of the card.</p>\n<h3>To See Cards in Other Players Pools</h3>\n<p>Look in the Combat Tracker. Hover your mouse over a card name to see the card.</p>\n<h1>Guide for GMs</h1>\n<p>Here are some basic tips/instructions for GMs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For the system to work correctly, each deck and discard pile must have a specific name. You can freely substitute one deck for another, but make sure that the deck that you want to use has the correct name. In particular, make sure that the Drama Deck you want to use is named \"Drama Deck\" and make sure that the Destiny Deck that you want to use is named \"Destiny Deck\".</li>\n<li><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Before players can access their hands, you need to set up the player hand. See the section below on setting up player hands for details on how this is done.</li>\n<li>You can freely drag and drop cards between hands, discard piles, and decks.</li>\n<li>You can shuffle and reset decks in the appropriate deck window.</li>\n<li>When you initiate a Combat in the Combat Tracker (see @Compendium[torgeternity.basic-rules.YkPR3np1UePORPcV]{Combat}), a new Drama card will be automatically drawn.</li>\n<li>Click on the \"New\" button in the combat tracker to advance to a new round and draw a new Drama card.</li>\n<li>Click on the \"Keep\" button in the combat tracker to advance to a new round, while keeping the current Drama card.</li>\n<li>The current Drama card is always contained in the Active Drama Card pile. If you make a mistake, or need to substitute a new Drama card for the current round, drag and drop the desired card into the Active Drama Card pile, move the incorrect card to the correct location (discard and/or the deck), and hit the refresh button in the Combat Tracker.</li>\n<li>If you want to reshuffle the contents of a discard pile back into a deck without pulling, you can do so by clicking the reshuffle button in the discard pile.</li>\n<li><strong>Getting Rid of Orphan Cards</strong>. It is recommended that you reset a deck before you delete it. If you don't do this, any cards in player hands and discard piles from that deck will remain. Currently, Foundry doesn't offer a way to get rid of those cards. However, here is the recommended work-around: create a temporary pile or hand and put all of the \"orphanded\" cards in it. Then, delete the temporary pile/hand.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Setting Up Player Hands</h2>\n<p>Before a player can access their hand, you must set up their hand for them. Setting up a player hand is a two-step process. First, you need to create a hand for the player's character. Second, you need to give the player permission to access the hand.</p>\n<h3>Creating a Hand</h3>\n<p>The easiest way to create a hand for a character is to open the Storm Knight sheet for that character and click the \"Open Hand\" button. This will create a hand with the correct name, but that hand will still need its permissions changed (see below).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note that if a player attempts to create a hand using the Open Hand button, it will generate an error message since players do not have permission to create their own hands in Foundry. As the GM, you will need to be the first one to open a hand for a character.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Changing Player Permission</h3>\n<p>To change the permissions for a hand so that a player can access it, do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open the Card Stacks tab</li>\n<li>Right click on the hand that contains the name of the player's character</li>\n<li>Click \"Configure Permissions\"</li>\n<li>Find the name of the player, and change the setting to Owner.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, if you want all players to be able to see and change all other players' hands, you can change \"All Players\" to Owner.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"A9LyAqagoJJU3gDH":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.TPyO53xtRrYkVoQD"}}}

They may still earn them and play them into their Action Pools (see @Compendium[torgeternity.basic-rules.YkPR3np1UePORPcV]{Combat}).</li>\n<li><strong>Up</strong>: The side with an Up rolls a die for tests, and then immediately adds another die regardless of the result!</li>\n<li><strong>Fatigue</strong>: Each hero immediately suffers 2 Shock (see Shock below). If the hero is wearing Armor with the Fatigues property she suffers 3 Shock instead, or more if the Armor lists a larger number! Some threats are immune to Shock, so a Fatigued result doesn’t hamper them at all!</li>\n<li><strong>Inspiration</strong>: Each character on the affected side recovers 2 Shock.

The only character with any magic is the Realm Runner, who has a magic potion. Carrying it creates a “Contradiction”, which means he’s out of step with reality at risk of @Compendium[torgeternity.basic-rules.OuHaBxUl8n5lojot]{Disconnection}.</li>\n<li><strong>Social Axiom</strong>: The low number means higher level civilization isn’t supported here. Democracy doesn’t make sense to people attuned to the realm…but following the strongest hunter and taking what you want does! If any Storm Knight had Psionic powers, they would be contradictory here.</li>\n<li><strong>Spirit Axiom</strong>: The high number means faith has tangible effects in the Living Land. Gods are real, and praying for miracles works without contradiction!</li>\n<li><strong>Tech Axiom</strong>: This is the number most of the Storm Knights present care about. Advanced technology is contradictory here. Each character has an Axiom listed for their items. If the number is above 6 the item is a Contradiction within the Living Land, so using it opens the character to the possibility of Disconnection.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>World Laws</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Law of Savagery</strong>: When battle rages, things get bloody in the Living Land. Don’t dwell on the exact meaning of this rule until combat starts. </li>\n<li><strong>Law of Life:</strong> Wounds heal quickly here, and dead matter decomposes rapidly as well.

A Disconnected character may still act and use Destiny Cards, but they may not spend Possibility tokens—so no adding dice to rolls or soaking damage! Any Contradictory items become unusable as they phase in and out of existence.

{"_id":"S5wSL3nDkI2GGoun","name":"Dramatic Skill Resolution","content":"<p>In Torg Eternity, a particulaly tense situation can be played out as a Dramatic Skill Resolution. The team has five rounds (i.e., five Drama Cards) to complete the mission, which consists of four different steps. After five rounds, the dramatic skill resolution results in a failure. However if the team completes all four steps in five rounds or fewer they succeed. The steps for the task are desiganted as Step A through Step D. The GM will determine the nature and difficulty at each step of the skill test.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Foundry System Note</strong>: The Combat Tracker includes a tool that allows you to track the current step in a dramatic skill resolution. By default, the tool shows \"No DSR\". By clicking on the tool, you can advance the DSR to Step A, and then - subsequently - to steps B through D.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Start a new @Compendium[torgeternity.basic-rules.YkPR3np1UePORPcV]{Combat} in the Combat Tracker to indicate the task has started, referring to the appropriate conflict line, based on whether the scene is Standard or Dramatic. Some or all of the letters A through D may appear in the block on the side of the card, along with different problems called Dilemmas. During a DSR a step may only be attempted its letter appears on the card, and each step must be performed in order. So if Step A appears, a Storm Knight may attempt the test that the GM designates for Step A.</p>\n<p>Only one Storm Knight can attempt a step during the round. Others may help by Combining their actions. Each chooses: grant the lead Storm Knight a simple +1 bonus—or attempt the test and grant nothing on a failure, a +1 bonus on a success, +2 on a Good success, or +3 on an Outstanding success. A DSR is an encounter, which means cards may only be played from the Action Pool. See @Compendium[torgeternity.basic-rules.YkPR3np1UePORPcV]{Combat} for more details relating to hands and action pools.</p>\n<p>The Storm Knights should choose who is attempting the step and let anyone else go first to stack up bonuses or get Supporter Destiny Cards into their Action Pools. If the lead fails the skill test can’t be attempted again that round. A different character may take the lead on every round.</p>\n<p>Not all DSRs happen undisturbed. Threats may be attacking the characters, and a combat round may be playing out at the same time as the DSR. The cards in play and number of Possibilities may be even more important than the character’s skills, so be flexible!</p>\n<h3>Multiple Steps</h3>\n<p>If multiple steps are available on the card, the lead Storm Knight may Multi-Action to attempt both steps. Roll a single bonus and apply it to both skill values, with an extra –2 Penalty for each extra action. So if Step A was already resolved and the next Drama Card listed both B and C the character taking the lead that turn could roll once with a –2 penalty and generate a total for steps B and C. Note that a Flurry gives the whole team an extra turn, which means two different steps might be attempted, and a different character might lead the second attempt!</p>\n<h3>Dilemmas</h3>\n<p>If a Dilemma appears on the card it counts as the current step being available (A if you’re just starting, B if you’ve completed A, and so on), but there’s a consequence for failure. Not trying at all for the round counts the same as failing!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Complication</strong>: Something happens that could potentially make the resolution of the DSR more difficult moving forward. If the step fails all future tests against the DSR suffer a –1 penalty.</li>\n<li><strong>Potential Setback</strong>: Something has happened which will require the party to go back and repeat a previous step. So if the group fails the test for step C during this round, they now must complete step B again instead.</li>\n<li><strong>Critical Problem</strong>: Something happens that threatens to completely undo the characters' progress. If they fail the step during this round, all completed steps are lost.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Last Ditch Effort</h3>\n<p>If it’s the fifth round and the steps aren’t present to complete the task, all isn’t lost. The team can try a Last Ditch Effort. This is a Multi-Action that must attempt every remaining step, and suffers an extra –2 penalty. So if steps B, C, and D were still left the Last Ditch Effort would suffer a –6 penalty to all three skills.

The DN for the test is equal to the target’s total in the same skill, so trick vs trick, maneuver vs maneuver, etc.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Foundry System Note</strong>: To make an interaction attack, first select your target by clicking on the Target icon in the upper left portion of your screen, then click on the desired target.

The conflict line indicates whether the Heroes (H) or the Villains (V) go first. The conflict line may also include conditions that affect one or both sides. See @Compendium[torgeternity.basic-rules.KTres6vCn1T1KcKO]{Drama Cards} for a description of what each condition means.</p>\n<p>When the heroes take their turn, each character may act in any order desired.

Flip over a new Drama Card for the next round.</p>\n<h3>The Action Pool</h3>\n<p>Until an encounter begins there’s no limit on trading or playing Destiny Cards. However, once battle is joined things get trickier! Cards may only be played or traded from each character’s Action Pool, and that pool starts off empty. At the end of each turn after the character acts, the player may put one Destiny Card in their pool by clicking on the check box in their hand (see @Compendium[torgeternity.basic-rules.9l3qvlJ9eFizcEor]{Managing Cards}). The card may then be played immediately, or at any time after that. Putting a card in the Action Pool isn’t playing it.
