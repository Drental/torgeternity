are a Victorian, and your world, Gaea, is caught in the grip of the Gaunt Man&rsquo;s horrors. You weren&rsquo;t content to be ruled by terror, and so you fought back. Against all odds you survived, and the various tricks, gadgets, and special weapons you&rsquo;ve acquired over years of battling evil have evened the odds considerably.</p>\n<p>When the Gaunt Man gathered his dark forces to travel through the maelstrom bridges and unleash their fury upon Core Earth, you followed to stalk them, just as you&rsquo;ve always done.</p>\n<h2>Tactics</h2>\n<p>The special shells in your Slayer&rsquo;s Gun gives you power and flexibility against specific foes, even outside of Orrorsh. Whenever you can, investigate what types of foes are likely to appear and prepare a custom load of shells to deal with them. Holy Water shells work well against gospog, a common enemy employed by all the High Lords. Even once all your specialized shells are used, your standard ammunition still packs a punch.</p>\n<p>You are highly resistant to fear and intimidation, but extremely vulnerable to taunt interactions. Victorians are notoriously haughty and intolerant of insults!</p>\n<h2>Moment of Crisis</h2>\n<p>Your crisis came long ago on Gaea. Maybe it was a werewolf, or perhaps it was a vampire. Whatever it was, it was a product of the Gaunt Man&rsquo;s evil. Tracking it back to its lair was foolhardy, but your attempt triggered a change in you. As a Storm Knight you finally had the power to fight back.</p>\n<h2>Quote</h2>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easier to stop fearing a thing once you have the power to destroy it.&ldquo;</p>\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Battling monsters is a dangerous profession, and you bear numerous scars attesting to that fact. Only some of those scars are visible. Victorians prefer modest dress, even in excruciating heat, and you&rsquo;re no exception. Your distinctive coat made of strange leather and the ornately decorated, oversized Slayer&rsquo;s Gun you carry are both giveaways to your profession.</p>\n<h2>Agenda</h2>\n<p>The destruction of evil is an imperative. If left to fester, monsters only become more vile and powerful. The High Lords, for all their tricks and facades, are just more monsters for you to stalk and terminate.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Ashton, Aubrey, Eli, Harper, Marion, Prester, Tanner, Thomas, Winter</p>\n<h2>Advancement Track (Optional)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>(5 XP) Sniper</li>\n<li>(7 XP) Bulletsmith (Explosive Shells)</li>\n<li>(1 XP) trick +1</li>\n<li>(2 XP) maneuver +2</li>\n<li>(3 XP) intimidation +3</li>\n<li>(3 XP) melee weapons +3</li>\n<li>(4 XP) fire combat +4</li>\n<li>(5 XP) fire combat +5</li>\n</ul>","race":"human"},"editstate":"inline","fatigue":"1"},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"modules/te001-core-rulebook/character-images/Monster_Hunter.Avatar.png?1616640986013","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Monster Hunter","displayName":30,"img":"modules/te001-core-rulebook/character-images/Monster_Hunter.Token.png?1616640986013","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"8KlJAaxeijOcrJKN","actorLink":true,"disposition":1,"displayBars":30,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"shock"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"9Kmq8C81nIIjwSdi","name":"Bulletsmith","type":"perk","data":{"category":"Occult","cosm":"Orrorsh","prerequisites":"At least 2 adds in science","timestaken":1,"description":"<p>Adventurers of Orrorsh long ago learned lead bullets and steel blades were no match for the horrors of their realm.

He receives his weapon and the knowledge to make basic metal slugs (damage 14) and any three of the specialized rounds below. Crafted for close encounters, the short-barrel carbine design of the slayer&rsquo;s gun allows it to be used in melee like a pistol.</p>\n<p>Because the bullets are necessarily large and require exacting specifications, monster hunters who make use of them have standardized a sixchambered, carbine-style gun to fire them&mdash;the rounds don&rsquo;t work in any other kind of weapon.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Slayer&rsquo;s Gun:</strong> Range 50/100/200, damage 14, Shots 6</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bulletsmiths can keep and maintain up to six special bullets as long as they have access to their gear (which always contains a small bullet-making kit). If more rounds are created, they lose the magical essence the Bulletsmith inherently provides and act as regular slugs (damage 14). Replacement rounds may be created between scenes, or during downtime if the Game Master feels it&rsquo;s appropriate.</p>\n<p>Slayer&rsquo;s guns are designed to rotate quickly and so can fire any one of their preloaded six chambers (specified before use).

A previously unknown side-effect of these rounds is that they can cause glitches in high-tech <em>electronic</em> equipment. Robots and machines take the extra damage, and sensitive equipment shorts out and is inoperable for three rounds</li>\n<li><strong>Explosive Shell:</strong> The most dangerous of the Bullet Smith&rsquo;s shells causes damage 15 in a Small Blast Radius</li>\n<li><strong>Giant Killer Shell:</strong> The Victorians developed these heavy shells to take down the Gaunt Man&rsquo;s biggest horrors. They cause +5 damage against Large or greater creatures</li>\n<li><strong>Holy Water Shell:</strong> +2 damage versus any supernaturally evil creature, including gospog, vampires, and undead</li>\n<li><strong>Phantom Shell:</strong> These rounds are made from various reagents such as cold iron, salt, and holy water that allows them to affect ethereal creatures normally</li>\n<li><strong>Silver Shell:</strong> Creatures with the Lycanthrope Special Ability take +4 damage from silver shells</li>\n<li><strong>Sun Shell:</strong> These rounds contain something the alchemists call <q>liquid sunlight.</q> They explode with ultraviolet light in a Medium Blast, causing any creatures <q>hit</q> by them to be Very Vulnerable if they have a sensitivity to light or sunlight.

Afterwards, it may be taken multiple times, but only after completing the event described in the individual awards.

The Delphi Council understands the mystical nature of these awards, however, and assists the Victorians in delivering them when possible. Work with the Game Master to figure out the timing of the medal itself, but it should generally occur no later than the act after it was earned.

This award is granted to anyone who takes part in the killing of a ravagon, his fiercest lieutenants.

The character adds +1 BD&nbsp;to all damage totals against all Large or greater-sized creatures (not vehicles or constructs) when Attack is an Approved Action</li>\n<li><strong>Order of Cynthia Bartholomew:</strong> Awarded for helping the injured or poor under great threat or for an extended period. <q>Ms. Bart,</q> as the poor called her, was a Victorian humanitarian who always helped the poor and downtrodden. Once per act, the recipient can touch an ally to remove all . This is a simple action</li>\n<li><strong>Victoria Gloriana:</strong> Awarded after personally playing a Glory card. This prestigious award is only granted to the country&rsquo;s greatest heroes. The medal grants a +1 bonus to any one attribute and its linked skills, chosen when the medal is awarded. Note that if the medal is worn and the attribute or linked skill is used, it does cause a Contradiction</li>\n<li><strong>Possibility Wars Campaign Medal:</strong> Awarded to any Storm Knight who participates in a Glory event. The medal is awarded per cosm, and may be used once per act to restore 1 BD of shock. This does not require an action and may be used at any time</li>\n<li><strong>Sole Survivor Medal:</strong> Awarded to the one person to return from an otherwise doomed expedition. The Sole Survivor medal cancels the effects of The Law of Perseverance and its recipient may Soak damage normally in Orrorsh.</li>\n<li><strong>India Campaign Medal:</strong> Awarded to any Storm Knight who recovers an Eternity Shard inside Orrorsh.

This award is a mixed blessing, as its presence also alerts Victorians that the wearer is cursed, which may lead to trust issues. The wearer&rsquo;s Corruption tests become Favored, and when a test fails the medal may be <q>burned</q> instead of losing Charisma.

ou were brilliant, and perhaps a bit odd, even before the Possibility Wars. After you transformed to fit the pulpy reality of the Nile Empire anything became possible. Immutable laws of physics are now mere guidelines. You push this new freedom to its limits, inventing wondrous electronic devices and then using them against the Possibility Raiders.</p>\n<h2>Tactics</h2>\n<p>Your Electro-Ray is effective, but it can run out of charges if used on too many targets too quickly. Your trick interaction is especially devastating. Many opponents are weak against trick, and a &ldquo;Player&rsquo;s Call&ldquo; result might eliminate even stronger foes when the circumstances support it.</p>\n<p>While your Force Field is operational you can use its charges to Soak Wounds. It can block two Shock even if there&rsquo;s no Wound, but it&rsquo;s better to save those charges. Once the Force Field is depleted, or if an untimely disconnection disables it, you are extremely susceptible to damage. If possible, hang on to a Destiny card like Willpower or Action to help reconnect if you get into a tight spot.</p>\n<h2>Moment of Crisis</h2>\n<p>Faced with an onslaught of invaders in Cairo you turned to science for a way to fight back, and in a moment of indescribable inspiration (and crisis) you reassembled a phone, a lava lamp, and a blow dryer into a deadly energy projector. Alternatively, you may have transformed while destroying some of your older inventions and plans before they could fall into the hands of Mobius and his hordes.</p>\n<h2>Quote</h2>\n<p>&ldquo;Whoa, who could have predicted a sudden polarity inversion would cause an explosion like that.

Runners are humans from Earth who have a strong, intuitive grasp of reality.

This phenomenon seems unique to Core Earth.</p>\n<h2>Tactics</h2>\n<p>You are a jack-of-all-trades: reasonably proficient with most weapons but a master of none. Then again, any weapon or item you find in any reality is fair game. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to try out and use powerful tools from other realities, even if they might cause Contradictions. Disconnections still happen, but not as often and it&rsquo;s easy for you to reconnect, even in a Pure Zone.</p>\n<p>Use any Approved interaction (trick is strongest) to Stymie opponents or make them Vulnerable. Success gains you a Destiny card and helps out the team&mdash;or enhances your own chances for a successful followup attack. Your high reality skill lets you Soak damage very reliably, so you&rsquo;re much tougher than you look.</p>\n<h2>Moment of Crisis</h2>\n<p>Before the invasion, every day was pretty routine.

p>A group of mysterious men and women have banded together to end Pharaoh Mobius&rsquo;s reign of tyranny. These heroes are based in Cairo, but travel across the globe to fight evil. The masks and mystery surrounding them are to protect their loved ones, or to foil Mobius&rsquo;s secret police. Being a hero is a deadly calling, especially in a world ruled by villains. A few rare crusaders hail from Terra, the home of the invaders, but most are transformed citizens of Core Earth.</p>\n<h2>Tactics</h2>\n<p>You are a crack shot and no stranger to fist fights. However, intimidation is your true weapon.

every preacher in the Cyberpapacy has fallen under Jean Malraux&rsquo;s sway. Many still believe in a far more benovelent and forgiving deity. These &ldquo;renegades,&ldquo; as the Antipope calls them, resisted his totalitarian regime, faced the Inquisition, and now fight on the streets with the resistance.</p>\n<h2>Tactics</h2>\n<p>Your miracles mostly provide support: keeping your allies fighting despite their wounds or boosting their critical abilities. The high-tech armor that lines your clothing offers good protection, and your high reality skill makes Soaking most Wounds easy.</p>\n<p>The integrated GodBeam laser in your arm can be a nasty surprise when things turn violent, but your true weapon is your interpersonal skills. Persuasion might avoid trouble entirely, and intimidation or taunt cause havoc with weak-willed foes.</p>\n<h2>Moment of Crisis</h2>\n<p>Your Moment of Crisis was likely a crisis of faith and conscience as well. The Cyberpope&rsquo;s flawed and ruthless vision brought out the lion inside you, and triggered the transition from &ldquo;father&ldquo; to Storm Knight.</p>\n<p>Or perhaps you simply prayed for divine intervention. The Almighty works in mysterious ways, and instead of smiting your foes, He gave you a little extra ability to fight for righteousness.</p>\n<h2>Quote</h2>\n<p>&ldquo;It is not with my eye that I see the world as it truly is, but with my faith.&ldquo;</p>\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>The white collar is a well-known symbol for the church in both Earth and Magna Verita. The sash worn around the waist varies in color depending on the priest&rsquo;s rank and region. The red one you wear was awarded for merit and good works.</p>\n<p>The cybernetic eye is a Belleview model, a common enough enhancement in the Cyberpapacy, but also a potential source of trouble if authorities realize it&rsquo;s been disconnected from the GodNet.</p>\n<h2>Agenda</h2>\n<p>Spread the love and forgiveness of God.

ns are Ayslish hunters and guardians who haunt the woods like ghosts, striking at enemies of the elves with stealth and guile. The longbow and green cloak are signatures of the wardens, as are the white wolves many keep as companions.</p>\n<h2>Tactics</h2>\n<p>You’re a ranged combatant through and through. The longsword is available in a pinch, but it’s usually better to hang back and focus on your bow. Drawing an arrow is a simple action, so you can target two or three opponents with a single attack.</p>\n<p>One tactic wardens find useful is to keep your wolf out of direct combat and have it intimidate instead. This can make the foe Vulnerable to a follow-up attack with your bow.</p>\n<p>If opponents manage to engage your furry friend, use Active Defense to protect it or soak damage using your own Possibilities.</p>\n<p>Watch out for Zones with a low Magic Axiom like Core Earth, the Living Land, and Pan-Pacifica, since elves suffer three Shock when Fatigue appears.</p>\n<h2>Moment of Crisis</h2>\n<p>Though the Wardens protect the forests of Aysle from dark forces, very few become Storm Knights. Your crisis likely came after following Lady Ardinay on her foolish quest to Earth. Facing the old foe in such a different place stirred something that defending the woods did not. It’s also possible you abandoned duty to save a dwarf or human, and in that selfless moment transformed.</p>\n<h2>Quote</h2>\n<p>“In the woods, all creatures are either hunters or prey. I assure you I am not prey.“</p>\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Wood elves are known for being quiet and shy, especially compared to their mystical cousins. Wardens wear mostly supple leather or densely woven cloth, just so long as it moves silently. Green is a favored color, even when outside the woods.</p>\n<h2>Agenda</h2>\n<p>The Elven Warden is privy to a dark secret kept by the elite among the High Elves, and has come to Core Earth out of a misplaced sense of guilt. Perhaps if the High Lords are defeated all the peoples of Aysle may finally know peace.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Amavae, Cimbar, Feyurit, Lief, Namys of Glaed, Nuvia, Rose, Tierra, Waldir</p>\n<h2>Advancement Track (Optional)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>(5 XP) Elven Archer</li>\n<li>(7 XP) Sniper</li>\n<li>(1 XP) lockpicking +1</li>\n<li>(2 XP) melee weapons +2</li>\n<li>(3 XP) dodge +3</li>\n<li>(3 XP) stealth +3</li>\n<li>(4 XP) missile weapons +4</li>\n<li>(5 XP) missile weapons +5</li>\n</ul>","race":"elf"},"editstate":null,"fatigue":"1"},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"systems/torgeternity/images/characters/Elven_Warden.Avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Elven Warden","displayName":0,"img":"systems/torgeternity/images/characters/Elven_Warden.Token.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"cdSvyJHbG0GbFzkh","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"q33jbisDvFLOCyfH","name":"Warden","type":"perk","data":{"category":"Elf","cosm":"Aysle","prerequisites":"Elf","timestaken":null,"description":"<p>Elven wardens roamed the wilderness of Aysle before Uthorion&rsquo;s Rage, always alert for threats to the good folk.

 reptilian inhabitants of Takta Ker are fierce and savage warriors. The environment is brutal, filled with carnivorous plants, hostile creatures, and giant carnivores. The edeinos see no contradiction in bringing death to their foes in the name of Lanala, the goddess of life. Death begets life. Decay seeds the soil which brings forth new growth. Optants are priests who embody Lanala&rsquo;s way, known as &ldquo;Keta Kalles.&ldquo;</p>\n<p>Most optants remain loyal to Baruk Kaah, but some believe the High Lord has actually abandoned Keta Kalles, and Lanala&rsquo;s faithful must now rise against him.</p>\n<h2>Tactics</h2>\n<p>Your strong arm and sharp &ldquo;hrockt shoot&ldquo; spear are enough to dispatch most foes. The strike miracle may enhance your spear when faced with a particularly tenacious foe. Intimidation interactions are also useful for softening up opposition. Your defenses are mediocre (taunts and tricks are your particular vulnerabilities), but with a high reality you can Soak most damage.</p>\n<h2>Moment of Crisis</h2>\n<p>Lanala commanded the edeinos to bring life to dead places in other worlds&mdash;or so Baruk Kaah said. In practice though, the sensations of war felt wrong to you, an affront to Lanala rather than an exultation of her. The feeling proved true when turning against Kaah triggered your transcendence.</p>\n<h2>Quote</h2>\n<p>&ldquo;I almost envy the pain you are about to experience.&ldquo;</p>\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>It may seem odd for a priest of life to wear a dinosaur skull and many bones, but death and decay are just another part of life. These aren&rsquo;t dead things&mdash; things of stone and metal that were never touched by Lanala&mdash;they were once alive. Like most edeinos you are informal, lacking the manners and social boundaries humans take for granted.</p>\n<h2>Agenda</h2>\n<p>The path to Lanala is through the experience of sensation&mdash;pain, pleasure, and rare feelings beyond both. Baruk Kaah and the High Lords are threats to Lanala, but the most important thing is to feel.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Bloodclaw, Dathil, Longjaw, Moonwalker, Razortooth, Riscaran, Stormtail, Wildeye</p>\n<h2>Advancement Track (Optional)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>(5 XP) Stone Skin</li>\n<li>(7 XP) Protected</li>\n<li>(1 XP) tracking +1</li>\n<li>(2 XP) dodge +2</li>\n<li>(3 XP) stealth +3</li>\n<li>(3 XP) melee weapons +3</li>\n<li>(4 XP) faith +4</li>\n<li>(5 XP) faith +5</li>\n</ul>","race":"edeinos"},"editstate":null,"fatigue":"1"},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"systems/torgeternity/images/characters/Edeinos_Optant.Avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Edeinos Optant","displayName":0,"img":"systems/torgeternity/images/characters/Edeinos_Optant.Token.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"hcdhRCs56U5JrAl4","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"5my70YmZnnaeEIRG","name":"Outsider","type":"perk","data":{"category":"Racial","cosm":"Living Land","prerequisites":"","timestaken":null,"description":"<p>Edeinos are outsiders to everyone but other edeinos.

Gangs, cartels, and even a corrupt conspiracy ring didn&rsquo;t make you back down, so why quit now?

Blocking a Stormer&rsquo;s ability to boost attacks is nothing to scoff at, and can quickly turn the momentum of any battle. Use intimidation to soften up your foes.

s transformed to the reality of the Living Land don&rsquo;t become Neanderthals as some rumors claim. They remain completely human, but are now perfectly adapted to the harsh physical environment and a low Social Axiom that makes certain thoughts contradictory. Confusing memories of their pretransformation life remain, but most just don&rsquo;t make sense anymore.</p>\n<p>These humans also hear the voice of Lanala and worship her the same way the edeinos do. Worshipers are known as &ldquo;jakkats,&ldquo; followers of the ways of Keta Kalles. Jakkats worship by savoring every sensation life has to offer.</p>\n<h2>Tactics</h2>\n<p>You usually just get close and stab or bludgeon your foes until they stop moving. You can throw your spear in the rare case where you don&rsquo;t wish to get too close to an opponent. All-Out Attack is usually a good option, either to trigger the Relentless Perk or to take advantage of the Law of Savagery when it applies. Maneuver is your interaction of choice, although intimidation works well in a pinch.</p>\n<p>The Sabre-Tooth Cat companion isn&rsquo;t a full-sized tiger, but its claws are deadly. Use its maneuver to set up your own attacks. Be careful with your friend; if he&rsquo;s slain it may be awhile before another comes along.</p>\n<h2>Moment of Crisis</h2>\n<p>Before the maelstrom bridges landed, you lived an ordinary life working a job you loved. After transforming, some spark of your independence remained. When the weak and soft people from your old life were attacked, you acted and became something more. It&rsquo;s also possible you transformed as a direct result of your heroic act, as if Lanala or some other force knew you needed augmented strength and deadly skills to take your battle to the High Lords.</p>\n<h2>Quote</h2>\n<p>&ldquo;How do you fight wearing all those...things?!&ldquo;</p>\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Jakkats don&rsquo;t wear much clothing. Leather, teeth, and bone are preferred, since at one time those things were alive. You also like body paints, the colors remind you of your previous life somehow.
